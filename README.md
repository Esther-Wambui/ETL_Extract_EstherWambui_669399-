# ETL Extract Lab

**Name:** Esther Wambui
**Student ID:** 669399

## Description

This project covers **Lab 3, Lab 4, and Lab 5** from the **DSA 2040A – Data Warehousing and Data Mining** course. 
It demonstrates the key stages of a real-world ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and Jupyter.

Covered ETL Stages::

- **Full Extraction** – loading the entire dataset and displaying key statistics.
- **Incremental Extraction** – extracting only new or updated rows since the last recorded extraction timestamp.
- **Data Transformation** – cleaning, enriching, and structuring the extracted data for analysis.
-**Data Loading** – Save transformed datasets into structured Parquet files.
The project also updated the timestamp after every incremental extraction.

## Tools Used

- Python 3.12  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- pandas  
- pyarrow (for Parquet support)  
- Pathlib (for cross-platform file handling)

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Esther-Wambui/ETL_Extract_EstherWambui_669399-.git
```

2. Open the project folder.

3. Run `etl_extract.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook**.

4. Files used:

   * sales_data_sample.csv → dataset used for the extraction.
   * last_extraction.txt → stores the timestamp of last extraction.

5. The notebook will:

   * Perform **Full Extraction** of the dataset.
   * Perform **Incremental Extraction** based on last_extraction.txt.
   * Save the new timestamp.

6. After running `etl_extract.ipynb`, two files will be created:

   * `transformed_full.csv` – the cleaned full dataset.
   * `transformed_incremental.csv` – the cleaned incremental dataset.

7. Then run `etl_load.ipynb` to load both transformed datasets into structured Parquet files.

8. This notebook will:

   * Load `transformed_full.csv` and `transformed_incremental.csv` using pandas.
   * Save each as a `.parquet` file using the `pyarrow` engine.
   * Create a `loaded_data/` folder (if not already existing).
   * Preview the first 5 rows from both Parquet files to confirm successful loading.

9. Output files from Lab 5:

   * `loaded_data/full_data.parquet`
   * `loaded_data/incremental_data.parquet`
  
10. Ensure you have `pyarrow` installed before running `etl_load.ipynb`:

```bash
pip install pyarrow 
```
