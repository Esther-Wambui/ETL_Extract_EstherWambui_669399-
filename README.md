# ETL Extract Lab

**Name:** Esther Wambui
**Student ID:** 669399

## Description

This project is for **Lab 3: Practicing Extraction in ETL**.
Demonstrating the process of performing **Full Extraction** and **Incremental Extraction** on a realistic dataset.

* **Full Extraction** loads the entire dataset and displays key statistics.
* **Incremental Extraction** extracts only new or updated rows since the last recorded extraction timestamp.

The project also updates the timestamp after every incremental extraction.

---

## Tools Used

* **Python 3.12**
* **pandas** library
* **Jupyter Notebook** (.ipynb)

---

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Esther-Wambui/ETL_Extract_EstherWambui_669399-.git
```

2. Open the project folder.

3. Run `etl_extract.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook**.

4. Files used:

   * `sales_data_sample.csv` → dataset used for the extraction.
   * `last_extraction.txt` → stores the timestamp of last extraction.

5. The notebook will:

   * Perform **Full Extraction** of the dataset.
   * Perform **Incremental Extraction** based on `last_extraction.txt`.
   * Save the new timestamp.
